```R
# This code attempts to read a CSV file, but it will fail silently if the file doesn't exist.

data <- read.csv("my_file.csv")

# The rest of the code will proceed even if data is NULL, leading to unexpected errors.
# This is especially problematic with functions that depend on data.
print(head(data))
```
