# Silent CSV File Read Failure in R

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in R: silent failure when attempting to read a CSV file that doesn't exist. The provided code reads a CSV file; however, it does not include error handling for the case where the file is missing. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug errors later in the code.

## Problem

The `read.csv()` function in R will return `NULL` if the specified file is not found.  However, the code continues to execute without explicitly checking for this `NULL` value, leading to potential errors in subsequent operations such as `print(head(data))`.  These errors might manifest as unexpected outputs or crashes, making them difficult to diagnose.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to check if the file exists before attempting to read it and handle the `NULL` result gracefully.  Robust code should always anticipate potential issues, such as missing files, and provide appropriate mechanisms for error handling.
